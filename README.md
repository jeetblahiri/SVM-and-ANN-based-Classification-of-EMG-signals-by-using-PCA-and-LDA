To carry out the pattern recognition for myoelectric applications, a series of features is extracted from the myoelectric signal for classification purposes. 
The feature classification can be carried out on the time domain or by using other domains such as the frequency domain (also known as the spectral domain), 
time scale, and time-frequency, amongst others. One of the main methods used for pattern recognition in myoelectric signals is the Support Vector Machines (SVM) 
technique whose primary function is to identify an n-dimensional hyperplane to separate a set of input feature points into different classes. 
This technique has the potential to recognize complex patterns and on several occasions, it has proven its worth when compared to other classifiers 
such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Principal Component Analysis(PCA).  

> We have used different feature extraction methods to extract suitable and distinctive features from the dataset for ease of classification. 
> We have used two different data analysis methods named Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction of the 
feature set for the sake of reducing the computational cost. 
> Finally we have used two different classifiers SVM and MLP for the classification of different action classes.
